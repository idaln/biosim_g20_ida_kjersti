Description
-----------

This is a simple simulation of the ecosystem of the island Rossum√∏ya.

The simulation shows how the distribution of animals throughout
the island changes over time and how the total number of animals from each
species changes over time.

Methods for simulation can be found in the simulation module,
the island and it's map in the island_map module, the different
landscape types are in the landscape module and lastly the
animals are in the animals module.

This island has
   * five different landscape types
   * two species of animals
